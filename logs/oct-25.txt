project setup:
    -> quad tree
    -> entities
    -> events
    -> player
    -> player controls
    -> hud

-> draw the dogs
-> move the dogs




moving the screen around, just a quick experiment for now

                // ! these values need to be clamped to avoid the repeating texture thing 
                view_frame.x +=  frame_offset.x;

*/ there is moving the screen around



-> bring over sprite and animation x 
-> fill out entities 
-> outline basic entity hierarchy
-> setup player controller
-> and hud 

-> let us consider how things will be drawn
-> there is a view frame for the game, kind of like the 2d version of the frustrum
-> instead of a frustrum it is just a rectangle
-> the cursor control changes this view frame
-> entities that fit in the frame are drawn
-> the background is drawn based on the view frame
-> the view frame is essentially a camera
-> there is a distinction between the background and the entities

-> where does it go, it is the player camera
-> but it is used mostly by the level if anything
-> i think the player is better for managing the hud and inventory, and controls 


22 / 10
-> cursor setup
-> player controls
-> cursor controls and associated events for dragging and interacting
-> singleton texture loading
