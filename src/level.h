/**
 * level is a more appropriate name I feel. A level is essentially a container that manages all of the entities
 * it organises the quadtree that stores the entities and handles other information about the level, perhaps any goals, 
 * the structure of rooms, the map, etc
 * 
 * perhaps a requirement to define two types of levels, the main hub and then exploration levels, but that can 
 * come later
